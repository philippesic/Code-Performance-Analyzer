You are an expert Python code generator. Produce ONE Python code example that fits the requested category below and answer with a single JSON object ONLY (no explanation, no markdown, no surrounding text).

Category:
{{category}}

Requirements for the generated JSON:
- Return exactly one JSON object with two keys:
  - "code": a string containing the full Python code (do NOT wrap in triple backticks; include imports and docstrings inline if needed).
  - "complexity": a string with the time complexity in big-O notation (e.g. "O(n log n)").
- The "code" value must be runnable Python where practical, cover edge cases, and use standard-library calls when relevant.
- Be diverse across multiple calls (vary algorithms, inputs, edge cases, data sizes, and standard-library usage).
- Do NOT include explanatory text outside the JSON.
- If you cannot produce runnable code, set "code" to an empty string and set "complexity" to "unknown".

Example (for formatting only — do not include these examples in the output):
{"code": "def example():\\n    pass", "complexity": "O(1)"}
